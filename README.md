## üìù Project Overview

Big Mart operates retail stores across various cities. The aim of this project is to forecast the **Item Outlet Sales** using historical data. This will aid Big Mart in:

- Optimizing inventory across stores
- Adjusting pricing and promotional strategies
- Improving profitability through data-driven decisions

---

## üì¶ Dataset Description

The dataset includes both product and store-level attributes.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Item_Identifier` | Unique ID for each product |
| `Item_Weight` | Weight of the product |
| `Item_Fat_Content` | Fat level of the item (`Low Fat`, `Regular`) |
| `Item_Visibility` | Visibility in store (%) |
| `Item_Type` | Product category (`Snacks`, `Fruits`, etc.) |
| `Item_MRP` | Maximum Retail Price |
| `Outlet_Identifier` | Store ID |
| `Outlet_Establishment_Year` | Store establishment year |
| `Outlet_Size` | Size of store (`Small`, `Medium`, `High`) |
| `Outlet_Location_Type` | Urban/rural/tier |
| `Outlet_Type` | Type of outlet (`Supermarket Type1`, etc.) |
| `Item_Outlet_Sales` | **Target variable** ‚Äî sales of the item at the outlet |

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand the relationships between features and identify patterns. Techniques used:

- Handling missing values (`Item_Weight`, `Outlet_Size`)
- Encoding categorical variables
- Distribution analysis of target variable
- Correlation heatmaps
- Box plots for outliers

---

## ü§ñ Model Building

Machine learning models used for regression:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

Techniques:

- Train-test split (70-30)
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- StandardScaler for normalization

---

## üß™ Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R¬≤ Score**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

Best performance was achieved using Random Forest and XGBoost.

---

## üí° Insights & Recommendations

- **Item MRP** is the most important feature influencing sales.
- **Outlet Type** and **Item Type** also play significant roles.
- Smaller outlets show lower average sales ‚Äî promotions can help boost them.
- Improving item visibility in-store positively correlates with higher sales.
